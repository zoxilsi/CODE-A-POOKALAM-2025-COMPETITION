## 🎨 My Pookalam

### Description
This project is a digital "Pookalam" (a floral carpet) created for the year 2025, with the text "RITU '25" at its center. The design is intricately layered with geometric patterns, lotus rosettes, and bead rings. The centerpiece of the artwork is a detailed representation of a "Theyyam" face, a traditional art form from Kerala, India. The entire artwork is generated programmatically using Python's `turtle` graphics library.

### Preview
To generate a preview, please run the script and take a screenshot of the output window. Save it as `pookalam-preview.png` inside an `output` directory.
